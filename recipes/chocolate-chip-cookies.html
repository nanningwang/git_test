    <ul> Ingredients
        <li>100 g (1/2 cup) sugar</li>
        <li>165 g (3/4 cup) brown sugar; packed</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>115 g (1/2 cup) unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li> 1 egg</li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li> 155 g (1 1/4 cups) all-purpose flour</li>
        <li> 1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li> 110g semi-sweet chocolate chunk, or milk chocolate </li>
        <li> 110g dark chocolate chunk, or your preference</li>
        <li> whole milk, to drink, optional</li>
    </ul>
    <ol> Preparation
        <li> In a large bowl, whisk together the sugars, salt, and butter until a paste has formed with no lumps.</li>
        <li> Whisk in the egg and vanilla, beating until light ribbons fall off the whisk.</li>
        <li> Sift in the flour and baking soda, then fold the mixture with a spatula, being careful not to overmix too much. This will cause the gluten in the flour to toughen which will result in cakier cookies.</li>
        <li> Fold in the chocolate chunks evenly, then chill the dough for at least 30 minutes. For a more intense toffee-like flavor and deeper color, chill the dough overnight. The longer the dough rests, the more complex its flavor will be.</li>
        <li> Preheat oven to 350Â°F (180Â°C).</li>
        <li> Scoop the dough with an ice-cream scoop onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, leaving at least 4 inches (10 cm) of space between cookies and 2 inches (5 cm) of space from the edges of the pan so that the cookies can spread evenly.</li>
        <li> Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges have started to barely brown.</li>
        <li> Cool completely, and serve yourself a glass of milk.</li>
        <li> Enjoy! </li>
